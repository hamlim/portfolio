  "Everyone I talk to who's tried Tailwind loves it. Folks who have not yet
  tried it dismiss it. Why is there so much resistance toward Tailwind?"

My background in web development was primarily HTML and CSS. I saw myself as a
CSS expert early on in my career. When I first was introduced to tailwind I was
initially skeptical, but that was until I built a few projects with it and saw
the pros drastically out weigh the cons.

## Utility first approach

## Customization

## Maintainabiltiy

## Prototyping

## Performance

## Large community and ecosystem

## The cons

Lots of folks complain about long class names. Yes this can be a pain, however,
there are many approaches we can take to solve this.

- We can use cn or clsx to create arrays of strings to manage this.
- We can create constants and use them in cn or clsx as well.
- You can come up with your own way of organizing these class names.
- You can add sorting mechanisms to reduce friction of class name changes.

## Where I think it's acceptable to prefer Modular styles

Tailwind can be incredibly fast. It's not just faster than vanilla CSS. It'sa

It alleviates some of the somewhat "harder" problems of CSS. Structure,
performance, splitting, etc.

### Conclusion

Being a successful developer or engineer is being willing to try new things.
Yes, Tailwind does take some of the hard parts of CSS and simplify them. CSS
specs are becoming easier and easier to use and we tend to praise these newer
solutions like flex, grid, etc. We should look to alternative framework
approaches the same. Embrace change and new tools by trying them out for a
period of time in applications or side projects and add another tool to our
toolkit. For me currently, I've been using Tailwind CSS on everything! üòÅ
