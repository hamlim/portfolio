Hey folks ðŸ‘‹,

In 2023 I decided to finally rebuild my portfolio site using Next.js. In 2024 I
decided I would start blogging my tech thoughts. Today I just updated the stack
in my blog but there are some exciting things I'd like to still work on!

<ul>
  <li>Update to App Router</li>
  <li>Add a page for my open source packages</li>
  <li>
    Blog my thoughts on things like CSS, TypeScript, Design Systems,
    Accessibility and working at a large tech organization.
  </li>
  <li>Add Github commenting!</li>
</ul>
