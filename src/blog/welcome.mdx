For 2023, I am planning to post my learnings & opinions as articles for frontend
engineering. I plan on writing my takes on new technology as well as sharing my
thoughts and patterns.

This portfolio was designed using NEXT.JS and Styled with Vanilla Extract. I
will be updating it to NEXT 13 the coming months. Stay tuned for more or find me
on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scottykaye) or
