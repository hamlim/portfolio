        As an engineer I am most passionate about helping others and helping
        develop work faster.

      <p className="my-3">
        I have a love for building cool and usable UI. I want engineers who use
        my tools to be able to focus on their goals and priorities while making
        sure we make the web accessible for everyone.

      <p className="my-3">
        My background and foundation in coding is CSS and HTML. In the past few
        years {`I've`} grown strongly in accessibility and JavaScript in my role

        The problem this package is solving for is that keyboard navigation
        often adds overhead to UI components. The goal is to abstract this in a
        way where we can get the appropriate navigation behavior for free and
        allow the UI components to be slimmer and focus on the goal of the
        component.{' '}

      <h3 className="text-lg mt-4">Accessible Block Links</h3>
      <p className="my-3">
        This was a project I got brought in on being an accessibility advocate.
        The issue was on our Browse page each individual product card would be
        wrapped in an anchor link which caused all the internal elements of the
        anchor tag to lose their semantic value.
      </p>
      <p className="my-3">
        The solution was to build a react hook that we could hook into to make a
        Product Card visually clickable but preserve {`it's`} semantic value.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-lg mt-4">Contextual Modals/Drawers/Sidebars</h3>
      <p className="my-3">
        I identified while working on the design system that we had the
        opportunity to create a hierarchy for our tools. The example I used was
        an admin toolbar that should wrap a page, but we {`don't`} want it to
        interact with the modals or other pop up elements.
      </p>{' '}
      <p className="my-3">
        I developed this contextual pattern concept that would leverage react
        portals to set boundaries between items. For example, for an admin user,
        we would set the entire application in the portal around the admin tool
        bar so the user could experience all modals, toasts and any other fixed
        or absolutely positioned elements appropriately and still use their
        toolbar.{' '}
