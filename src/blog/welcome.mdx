Hey folks ðŸ‘‹,

In 2023 I decided to finally rebuild my portfolio site using Next.js. In 2024 I
decided I would start blogging my tech thoughts. Today I just updated the stack
in my blog but there are some exciting things I'd like to still work on!

<List>
  <List.Item>Update to App Router</List.Item>
  <List.Item>Add a page for my open source packages</List.Item>
  <List.Item>
    Blog my thoughts on things like CSS, TypeScript, Design Systems,
    Accessibility and working at a large tech organization.
  </List.Item>
  <List.Item>Add Github commenting!</List.Item>
</List>
