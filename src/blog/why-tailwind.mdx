  "Everyone I talk to who's tried Tailwind loves it. Folks who have not yet
  tried it dismiss it. Why is there so much resistance toward Tailwind?"

My background in web development was primarily HTML and CSS. I saw myself as a
CSS expert early on in my career. When I first was introduced to tailwind I was
initially skeptical, but that was until I built a few projects with it and saw
the pros drastically out weigh the cons.

## Utility first approach

One of the main differences but advantages of Tailwind is the utility first
approach. Tailwind allows you to use predefined class names directly in your
code.

Folks who prefer, a modular approach to CSS are often turned off at this. I
myself felt this way at first even with experience to both utility and modular
approaches. I find those who are really deep into CSS like the freedom that
comes with a modular approach as it feels fresh and separates concerns.

The biggest argument and long running joke against tailwind are super long class
names.

There are many approaches to managing this:

- Using a [clsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) function to create arrays
  of strings to manage organization.
- Creating constants and use them in your class names or clsx functions.
- Using sorting mechanisms to reduce friction of class name changes.

This allows you the opportunity to organize class names similar to how you may
want to organize modular styles.

The most important benefit Tailwind provides by this utility class first
approach is since classes are tied to single or a few CSS dthat it only has to
record a class declarations, it only has to record them once in the style sheet.

For example, if you use `display: flex` or `margin: 1rem` multiple times in
classes in your modular style sheets, those are only recorded once in your CSS
style sheet with Tailwind, reducing the cost of size of a style sheet.

```jsx
// Tailwind - These two classes are reused every time you use these CSS declarations
.m-4 {
  margin: 1rem;
}
.flex {
  display: flex;
}

// Modular - We will find ourselves writing declarations more than once
.MyClass {
  display: flex;
  margin: 1rem;
}

.MyOtherClass {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  margin: 1rem;
}

```

By definition, we will always have leaner styles heets using Tailwind due to
this approach.

## Customization

Tailwind supports endless customization, you can easily customize your
configurations:

- Configuration
- Specify files that use Tailwind
- Custom themeing
- Screen sizes
- Spacing
- Colors
- Typography
- Countless plugins
- Presets for your default theme

## Prototyping

It is a tool that allows you to more rapidly prototype because you're given some
presets that allow you to hit the ground running right away. It's important to
remember though Tailwind is not bootstrap. Yes it comes out of the box
unopinionated and it's a strong prototyping tool but the ability to customize it
so heavily is there for you to form opinions on its use and how the application
should leverage it.

## Performance

Where Tailwind shines most brightly is its ability to do all the hard parts of
performance for you. Without Tailwind traditionally when running your
application against performance metrics, (especially large enterprise
applications) you will likely have to determine which CSS is critical or above
the fold. Typically teams have to create a solution to the`<head/>` with
critical CSS and immediately hydrate critical CSS. All of this is taken care of
for you in Tailwind.

## Maintainability

Tailwinds

## Large community and ecosystem

Tailwind currently has over 82K stars on GitHub and is actively growing. There's
huge community support around this styling library with many trusted
contributors and active [plugins](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins).

## Where I think it's acceptable to prefer Modular styles

Tailwind can be incredibly fast. It's not just faster than vanilla CSS. It'sa

It alleviates some of the somewhat "harder" problems of CSS. Structure,
performance, splitting, etc.

Simply put, being a successful developer or engineer reuqires a willing to try
new things.

Yes, Tailwind does take some of the hard parts of CSS and simplify them. CSS
specs are becoming easier and easier to use and we tend to praise these newer
solutions like flex, grid, etc. We should look to alternative framework
approaches the same. Embrace change and new tools by trying them out for a
period of time in applications or side projects and add another tool to our
toolkit. For me currently, I've been using Tailwind CSS whenever I spin up a new
app. üòÅ I do still use CSS and regular styles in my quick
[Codepen's](https://codepen.io/scottykaye) and when Tailwind might not have a
class out of the box for prototyping.
